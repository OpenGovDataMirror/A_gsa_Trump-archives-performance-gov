## Background

Performance.gov is a window into Federal agencies’ efforts to deliver a smarter, leaner, and more effective government. The site provides the public, agencies, members of Congress, and the media a view into the progress underway to cut waste, streamline government, and improve performance.

Performance.gov allows the public to learn more about the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), the Federal performance management framework, and the federal goal-setting process for driving progress in key management areas and priorities. The Federal Government uses the framework to manage Federal performance and achieve the vision set out in the PMA.

Performance.gov communicates the goals and objectives the Federal Government is working to accomplish, how it seeks to accomplish those goals, and why these efforts are important. All cabinet departments and nine other major agencies have agency pages on Performance.gov. Each agency’s page provides an overview of the agency, its mission, priority goals to be achieved, and links to its strategic and performance plans and reports.

We invite you to use Performance.gov to discover how government is working for the American public.

## Getting started

We’re glad you’d like to use the Site — here’s how you can get started:

* Access performance information by agency, including information on agency established Priority Goals and links to each agency’s strategic plan, performance plans and reports, and other guiding documents.
